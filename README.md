# unique-groupings
Small java group generator project

Given a list of people belonging to some groups and a "ranking" for each person, the program will generate an optimal new group set such that none of the people have been grouped together before. Will then attempt to minimize the standard deviation of the rankings, creating the "fairest" arrangement where each group has a similar average ranking.
